					<h2>Format</h2>
					<p>On 29 November 2023, we’re planning an all-day global event. We’ll have 24 sessions – so, at least 24 countries, but not more than 1 contribution per country. <br> <br> The aim is to bring together colleagues from all parts of the globe – not just the Global North, and co-create the most complete overview of the state of government innovation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column-half">
					<h2>Participation</h2>
					<p>As of now, the theme is open – public sector service innovation. We may identify more specific themes for the day as we get contribution ideas and start to shape the agenda.</p>

          <p>You can let us know you’re interested in attending the conference by <a href="https://forms.gle/rj4BvZSHs4rTtNSd7">filling in this form</a>.</p>

			<h2>About the community</h2>	
			<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>
      <p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community, the conference and monthly calls, you can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">apply to join the Slack group</a>.</p>
      <p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join, you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>
      <p><a href="intl-govdesign-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">Email the community management team</a> if you have any questions.</p>
