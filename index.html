				<p>In 2017, the <a href="">Government Digital Service</a> established a community of international designers working in, for and with governments across the world.</p> 
				<p>The international design in government community has grown to over 650 members from over 47 countries over the past year. The community has developed online via the mailing list, Slack and monthly calls.</p>

				<p>But strong communities are built through meeting in person, so we‚Äôre running a conference. We can‚Äôt wait to meet everyone face-to-face, exchange ideas, create connections, and find opportunities for collaboration.</p>
