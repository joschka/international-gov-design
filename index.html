				<h2>Join the community</h2>

				<p>The International Design in Government community is a group of design-minded people from governments all over the world. The purpose is to learn from each other, share best practice and design patterns, and discuss shared challenges so that we can try and work on them together.</p>

				<p>The community has a Google Group, Slack group, monthly calls and events in various cities. You can <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/category/international/">read about the activities on the Design in Government blog</a>.</p>

				<p>If you work in government and you’d like to join the community and the monthly calls, you can <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/international-govdesign">apply to join the Google Group</a> and the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/intlgovdesign/signup">Slack group</a>.</p>

				<p>The community is open to designers, user researchers, content designers, accessibility experts and other design-minded people. In order to join you must be working embedded in government at any level: national, state or city — this includes consultancies that contract solely for government.</p>

					<li style="padding-bottom: 45px;">
					<p>In 2017, the Government Digital Service established the international design in government community. A community of international designers working in, for and with governments across the world.</p>

					<p>The international design in government community has grown to over 1500 members from over 66 countries over the past two years. The community developed online via a mailing list, Slack and monthly calls.</p>

					<p>In summer 2018, 220 community members from 26 countries came together in London to exchange ideas, create connections, and find opportunities for collaboration at the first International Design in Government Conference.</p>

					<p>In 2019, there will be various international events organised by community members. Learn more about the 2019 events in <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/27/were-helping-to-run-3-global-international-design-in-government-events/">this blog post</a>.</p>
